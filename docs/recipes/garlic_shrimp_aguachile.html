         <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This corned beef stroganoff, with mushrooms, creme fraiche, and 
                dill, is a switch from the classic St. Patrick's Day preparation. 
                The result is amazing—it really does taste like a proper 
                stroganoff, but even more flavorful.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>For Aguachile:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup packed cilantro leaves</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
                    <li>1/2 serrano chile pepper, sliced, or to taste</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup fresh lime juice, from 2 to 3 limes</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup water</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>For Shrimp:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 pound raw shrimp - peeled, meticulously deveined, and sliced in half horizontally if large</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
                    <li>1 cup thinly sliced peeled cucumber</li>
                    <li>1 jalapeno, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, or as needed</li>
                    <li>tortilla chips, for serving</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine cilantro, garlic, serrano chile, lime juice, water, salt, pepper, and sugar in a tall cup or the jar of a blender; blend with a stick blender or regular blender until smooth. Refrigerate aguachile while other ingredients are prepared.</li>
                    <li>Add shrimp, cucumber, and red onion to a bowl, and pour in aguachile. Stir well, and press shrimp down into aguachile to cover. Wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook's Note:</strong> The dish can be served immediately, but refrigerating for 30 minutes to 1 hour will achieve a more ceviche-like (“cooked”) texture. The dish can also be tightly covered and refrigerated overnight to serve the next day.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle aguachile with jalapeno slices and cilantro to garnish, and serve with tortilla chips.</li>
