         <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This corned beef stroganoff, with mushrooms, creme fraiche, and 
                dill, is a switch from the classic St. Patrick's Day preparation. 
                The result is amazing—it really does taste like a proper 
                stroganoff, but even more flavorful.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>8 ounces brown mushrooms, sliced</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup diced onions</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
                    <li>1 cup reserved corned beef cooking liquid</li>
                    <li>2 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup creme fraiche, plus more for garnish</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place corned beef along with the contents of spice packet into a pot, and cover by 2 inches with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours 15 minutes. While corned beef is cooking, occasionally add more water to keep the level near where it was when it started boiling.</li>
                    <li>Remove corned beef to a bowl, and let cool until cool enough to handle, at least 30 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid.</li>
                    <li>When meat is cool, slice off most of the fat. Cut meat with the grain into thick strips, and then turn and slice into thin, bite-sized pieces. Reserve until needed.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt to the hot pan, and cook and stir until mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Add onions, and continue cooking until they soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add butter and stir until melted.</li>
                    <li>Make a space in the center of the pan, add garlic, and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour, and cook and stir for 1 minute more. Pour in white wine and reserved corned beef cooking liquid, and stir to combine. Raise the heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring, until sauce reduces by about half and thickens, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Stir in beef broth, and continue to boil and reduce until sauce thickens again, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in crème fraiche, and reduce until the sauce is as thick as you’d like, a few more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in sliced corned beef, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh dill.</li>
                    <li>Garnish each serving with a small dollop of crème fraiche or sour cream and a little fresh dill.</li>

                <h4>Chef's Note:</h4>
                <p><em>"An option is to cook the corned beef a day ahead, and chill in the refrigerator. It is easy to remove the fat and slice when very cold.</em></p>
