         <h2>What's Simmering Today</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="./recipes/corned_beef_stroganoff.html" target="Blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">
                        Corned Beef Stroganoff:</a></strong>This corned beef 
                        stroganoff, with mushrooms, creme fraiche, and dill, is a
                         switch from the classic St. Patrick's Day preparation. 
                         The result is amazing—it really does taste like a proper 
                         stroganoff, but even more flavorful.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="./recipes/garlic_shrimp_aguachile.html" target="Blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">
                        Garlic Shrimp Aguachile:</a></strong>If you like sushi, 
                        sashimi, ceviche, or fish crudo, or even if you just 
                        like beautiful, delicious, easy things to make, this 
                        garlic shrimp aguachile is for you. Aguachile, or 
                        “chile water,” uses lime juice to “cook” the shrimp, 
                        or, if served immediately, to just make the shrimp 
                        taste fabulous. And you are going to serve it on 
                        tortilla chips, so if you weren't tempted already, 
                        now you certainly are.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="./recipes/easy_swedish_apple_pie.html" target="Blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">
                        Easy Swedish Apple Pie:</a></strong>This Swedish apple pie
                         bakes cinnamon apples topped with a golden cake-like 
                         crust. No rolling out dough required! Pairs wonderfully 
                         with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel.</li>
                </ul>
